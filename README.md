# Sgvizler webjar

Webjar for [Sgvizler][1], a javascript which renders the result of `SPARQL SELECT` queries into charts or html elements. It is cool stuff!

## Current Version

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
    <artifactId>sgvizler</artifactId>
    <version>0.6-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

## Dependencies

Besides *jQuery*, which can be included using webjars, Sgvizler also requires the [Google Visualization API][2], so don't forget to include it:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
```
